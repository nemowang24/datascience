1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:14,440
okay let's start now first everybody I
want you to open the open the canvas and

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:22,180
go to the home page

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,590
make sure you read the syllabus so the
requirement is on the syllabus this

4
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,000
particular course for

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,840
for the computational foundations we
require everybody there are homeworks

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,680
there are quizzes

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,280
will be projects and if the due date is
specified you should submit before the due

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,880
date and only in

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,230
case that is uncontrollable say if you
have a special case you need to send your

10
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,580
note and say

11
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,360
if you get sick get the get the say
doctors or your your relatives

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,140
somebody can can validate your

13
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,850
situation and so that's special case
otherwise you should be on time that is

14
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,560
one thing the other

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,850
thing is what of course we are going to
have mostly using programming of

16
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:28,140
Python and you can use

17
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,670
chat GPT or other language models AI to
assist your learning but you cannot

18
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,760
just copy and paste

19
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,070
submit your homework as whatever
whatever you have see if you have a

20
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,380
problem you really cannot solve

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,640
it and you ask the chat GPT to help you
that is fine and after you get the result

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,900
after you get

23
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,350
some answer you write down because this
is not originally you make you think

24
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,800
from from your by

25
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,200
you provide the reference say okay if
you go to chat GPT or other other let's

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,820
see this any other

27
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:15,360
any other uh model it allows you to
share so uh tell me

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,960
uh uh let's see merge sort this is the

29
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:36,480
okay let's see this and once you have that
uh result

30
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,920
then there is always a button to
share so go to the share button

31
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,210
okay I will give you the one example of
doing that uh every every model has it

32
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,220
it's at a

33
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,900
different place so once you're shared
it everybody can can see this so the

34
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,580
purpose is to have the

35
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,780
whole dialogue you are not just directly
asking the result uh asking the the

36
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,980
answer so

37
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,830
um you should not copy the problem and
ask chat GPT to do it for you and then

38
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,080
you get answer you

39
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,700
can ask this part please explain and
then you work on from there that is fine

40
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,320
then the whole dialogue

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,990
we will show that okay that's the
purpose of doing that I will give you

42
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,660
a concrete example for this

43
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,040
uh they changed the the uh uh cloud change
the uh button for that I will I will

44
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,420
get that later on and

45
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,590
office hour for this course, it will be
Thursday. So we have the Tuesday and

46
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,600
the Thursday. So

47
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,910
Thursday afternoon, right after
the class, it is working hour. You can

48
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,280
go to my office

49
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,320
for questions. If you have a question
during the class, if we can do it in

50
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,360
the class, we

51
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,350
will do it. Normally, if it is very
personal, we want you to go to the office.

52
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,340
If everybody

53
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,470
has a similar question, then we do it in
the class. And before the class,

54
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,600
normally, like

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,060
when I do the preparation, you come to
ask me the questions, that is not a

56
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,520
good time

57
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,500
because my mind is not there. I need
to set up everything. So after the

58
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,480
class, right?

59
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,740
So this course will cover three parts.
Assuming everybody already has some

60
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,860
foundational skills

61
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,340
for programming.

62
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,390
And then we will go over the Python
program. However, we will just not

63
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,440
go with the very

64
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,550
basic part. That part is your own job.
You need to make up. If you didn't do

65
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,660
any Python

66
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,420
before, then you need to make it up. I
will give you some resources. And

67
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,180
then after that,

68
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,130
we are going over for the first two
weeks, the object -oriented programming

69
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,840
with Python,

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,140
which means we are going to cover with the
Python.

71
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,080
Python class, Python objects, and
user-defined class and objects and

72
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,020
stuff like that because

73
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,480
that is the major application and we are
going to use later on when you do the

74
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,940
machine learning

75
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,670
and other packages. So that is the
big part. And then we will also extend

76
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,400
this for doing

77
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,720
the data structure and the algorithms.
You will see we will use a lot of the

78
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,040
Python class.

79
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,760
And the object and stuff. So for the
algorithms. So we do the two weeks for the

80
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,380
OOP. And then

81
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,590
the remaining part mostly will be like
10 weeks. We will be talking about

82
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,800
theizzegtrichter

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,460
and algorithms. This is the key part.And
finally, we will go quickly over

84
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,920
the very basic foundational

85
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,800
skills.

86
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,420
Okay.

87
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,120
Okay.

88
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,780
database, mostly it will be SQL. Okay,
that's the outline of this course.

89
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,440
So today, I want

90
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,940
everybody just go to your Canvas. So I
have an announcement here. Go to the

91
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,440
announcement

92
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,120
and see the class materials. We have the
strict rule for the class. During the

93
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,800
class, when

94
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,710
I say everybody, you can use
laptop, that's okay, you use laptop. If I

95
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,620
say close laptop

96
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,750
and we want to do something that you
should do on the paper, then you

97
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,880
should not use laptop.

98
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,310
And throughout the class, you
should not use phone. You can

99
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,400
use tablet to take notes, but

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,820
do not use phone. Okay?

101
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,780
Okay, I think that's it.

102
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,480
I think we should spend a few minutes
first because this is the first class.

103
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,160
Everybody

104
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,910
wants to introduce yourself a
little bit so everybody knows each other.

105
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,660
Starting from

106
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,520
Wang Huan. Yeah. Introduce yourselves.
Yeah, yeah, turn around. Turn around to

107
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,700
the classmates.

108
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,780
So your name, where you're from, and your
background. Anything that you want to say.

109
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,120
Anything that is, get your classmates to
know about you.

110
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,300
And her name, do she have a number?

111
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,040
And your students?

112
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,180
Yeah do they know all the questions?

113
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,660
No.

114
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,680
No, got them already.

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,840
Okay.

116
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,520
okay thank you and my

117
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,080
okay thank you long way

118
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,120
okay thank you

119
00:10:51,780 --> 00:11:02,680
thank you

120
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:28,500
um

121
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,500
Okay, thank you.

122
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:03,140
Have you have any other programming
language skills, any experience before?

123
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:04,980
Okay.

124
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,600
Can you spell your name?

125
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,520
How do you spell your name?

126
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,520
Your name is not here.

127
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,420
Your name is not on Canvas yet.

128
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,460
So make sure you go.

129
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,000
No, no, no, no, that's, that's Wayne.

130
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,080
Oh, me, okay, yeah.

131
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,600
Oh, I'm confused because I always thought
me is a boy.

132
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,900
It can be.

133
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,960
Yeah, all right.

134
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,520

.

170
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:19,050
All right, thank you about a little
bit of myself, my name is Jen Chi and I

171
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:19,050
graduated from University of
Chicago with a PhD in atmospheric

172
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:19,050
science, so I have a science background,
then after graduation my most of my job

173
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:28,780
is in the research.

174
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,940
I work at NASA jet propulsion
laboratory in California and then.

175
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:43,370
And late in later I've been there for
15 years I work at also in another

176
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:43,370
company called the region, which is the
company making missiles for the Defense

177
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:50,800
contract.

178
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:58,190
They also work with NASA so my my most
research work is in the earth sciences

179
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:05,280
atmospheric science and research topics,
including Mars oceans.

180
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:14,760
And earth atmosphere, then the the
in later years, so the shifting of

181
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:14,760
the research, this is physical
shifting has there's a trend before

182
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:23,580
you have the physical models, so you have.

183
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,860
You have the newton's function equations
define your models, how the particles

184
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,140
moves hard atmosphere move the oceans, how
the current moves and then.

185
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,720
Later on, this is not enough, then that's
about 10 years ago.

186
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,810
You want to find out the principles or
patterns from your data, so that is how

187
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:56,740
emerge how the data science emerged in
every scientific area, and this is.

188
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,960
In what I have worked at there, and so
that is the model you use the statistical

189
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,480
method to model.

190
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:12,080
Your data and try to find out a
patterns, and so that is the the the way I

191
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,080
got into the data science and the at the
very beginning, there's no term called

192
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,220
the data science and.

193
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:27,200
In 2018 one one fit in college establish I
came here, I joined a fit in and I also

194
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,200
worked at another pharmaceutical
company called the Merck, which is the

195
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:35,020
number four pharmaceutical company United
States.

196
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,080
And so I'm doing I did some.

197
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,920
Statistical work for consulting at
that company.

198
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,640
So for this course.

199
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:55,600
We are going to emphasize on the
foundational skills and knowledge and

200
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:55,600
we are going to use a lot of projects,
so you, you are going to have a hands

201
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:03,260
on experience so mostly programming but.

202
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,700
The first thing is for.

203
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:16,470
For those of you who did not program in
Python very much some of you have some

204
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,470
experience before, but some of you
complete do not have any background,

205
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,470
the first thing is this open this
announcement go to this Kaggle there

206
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:27,240
is a short tutorial for Python.

207
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,280
And so now everybody follow me.

208
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,160
Kaggle is a platform for data science.

209
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,920
They provide a free running environment so
everybody can run a code in there and they

210
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:49,360
also offer competitions in data
science, so it is prized competition and.

211
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:56,850
There are some other competition
that is no price, but the most of the

212
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:56,850
students many students worldwide join the
competition to form the skills from

213
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:03,760
the skills for for the data science.

214
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,580
And we are going to.

215
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,060
Also encourage everybody to attend this
and we will pick some of the project

216
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:16,420
ask you to do it right and then so let's
let's try this.

217
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:26,030
Once you go there once you once you open
this make sure you're logging Okay, I

218
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,030
already logged in so once you log in you
will you will be you just use your Google

219
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,030
account, you can use your school account
use your school account as your Google

220
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:34,780
account login.

221
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,640
Once you login you can run it
otherwise you can only do it it is very

222
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,580
important in data science do not Read and

223
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:53,100
Watch that is not enough that's only
half of the learning you have to do it

224
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,100
hands on you have to do it okay once you
see this, this is this is interactive So

225
00:18:53,100 --> 00:19:01,300
this is notebook you can run and
notebook has the advantage you can.

226
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,480
Not only have the text, you can have
images, you can.

227
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,150
have the code embedded over there. So in
this case, let's see, I will just

228
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,820
quickly go over

229
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,750
this and the remaining part is your own
homework. You need to do this. Within

230
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,680
the first two

231
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,510
weeks, you should finish this, seven
lessons. So with this, not very long,

232
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,740
seven notebooks.

233
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,630
Complete this. And then there
are exercises. There are exercises you

234
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,520
can practice.

235
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,280
So let me show you the exercise.

236
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:50,440
At the end of the notebook, actually,
there are exercises at the end.

237
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,500
See, your turn. Once you finish
practice with this,

238
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
go to your turn.

239
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:04,180
you can do the exercise over there and
there if you haven't done this so there

240
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,020
are some there are some trick
here you need to go to the you you need

241
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,860
to make

242
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:20,750
your own copy of the notebook so
say here this way you can edit it so

243
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:27,640
make a

244
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:35,840
copy in your own account let me do this
so click click this three dot make a

245
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:43,040
copy okay now it is in your own account
now you can add it this you can run it

246
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,840
and

247
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,140
this only happens once you log in
okay I'll wait everybody to log in and

248
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,420
make a

249
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,000
copy and then we could go

250
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,600
this one what happens you click on

251
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,700
okay everybody first go over there log in

252
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,880
no once you're logging in the
pop-up Google account that you you choose

253
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,860
logging as Google

254
00:21:43,860 --> 00:22:00,040
okay give me your notebook anybody else
has a problem sorry oh you mean campus

255
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:10,680
now you use then you use other oh yeah
then you use the person or email okay we

256
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,500
need to open this we need open this

257
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,440
So, use your personal Gmail.

258
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,160
Everybody get in here?

259
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,420
Where's your notebook?

260
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,260
Where's your laptop?

261
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,880
Okay, so next time.

262
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,980
Anybody else has trouble?

263
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,700
Ming?

264
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:39,780
Ming?

265
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,640
You don't have a laptop?

266
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,360
Do you have it?

267
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,740
In Duong?

268
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:48,900
Okay.

269
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,790
So once you get in there, raise your
hand if you are here, you are in this

270
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,800
stage.

271
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,300
Make a copy, no?

272
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,060
What happens?

273
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,920
What's the problem?

274
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,140
What happens if you click on the three
dots?

275
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,500
Yeah, login.

276
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,820
And then once you login, say this, this,
this, click here.

277
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,100
So first, once you click, that's three,
seven lessons, right?

278
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,860
Click on this.

279
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,220
And then click on this.

280
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,500
And then make a copy and edit.

281
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,140
Yeah.

282
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,980
Click on this.

283
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,880
All right.

284
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:58,280
So once you are in there, once you are
in this, you can, you can see your past

285
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:04,620
notebook

286
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,160
by clicking.

287
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,460
You can click on your own icon and then
there is, there is your work.

288
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,340
That's list of the notebook you have in
here.

289
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,820
So, but for now you have only one if
you didn't do this before.

290
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,760
So now once you open this, oh, by the way,
everybody, you should audit the

291
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,540
introduction

292
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,480
to computing.

293
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,280
Anybody who did not go in the morning.

294
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,600
That's 830 today.

295
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,360
If you didn't go, raise your hand, let me
know.

296
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,660
Who didn't go?

297
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,540
Okay.

298
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,140
You should go over there.

299
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,100
So, okay.

300
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,700
You, you are fine.

301
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,080
You should go over there.

302
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,900
Everything here is taught in that class.

303
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,500
You audit for that.

304
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,440
You don't, you do not, you do
not need, you can either audit, but

305
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,260
it's preferred audit.

306
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,730
Or you can, you can just sit in, but if
you sit in, you do not have access to

307
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,200
Canvas and

308
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,460
all the homework and assignment,
you do not have those.

309
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,000
So you want to, you want to at least
sit in, but it is preferred everybody go

310
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,180
and audit

311
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,420
this.

312
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,170
Unless you have been doing Python a
lot, a lot in the past, but here,

313
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,460
everybody, no,

314
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,800
I think everybody should go.

315
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,440
All right.

316
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,800
So now I'm quickly going to go over,
over here.

317
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,880
See here.

318
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,920
Now you have a, you have the code.

319
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,860
This is called a code cell.

320
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,760
And you have this, this part, this is
called a text cell.

321
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,660
Double click on this, double click
on this, and you can edit this.

322
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,480
So both cells can be edited.

323
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,960
And once you are done with, with the
editing, click on this running button

324
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,140
and it becomes

325
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,500
this.

326
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,520
It's fixed.

327
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,760
Yeah.

328
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,840
Run over this text cell, then it will
be fixed.

329
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,910
And then for this part, see, this is
assigned zero to this variable and

330
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:16,220
then make some simple

331
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,800
calculation then with some condition and
the print.

332
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,840
So if you want to run this code, just
click on this, it will run.

333
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,080
See here, that's the output.

334
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,920
And you can also.

335
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,240
You can also modify this.

336
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:42,460
So you can say, you can add something
to the print.

337
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,300
So let's, let me run this again.

338
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,360
See here.

339
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,800
All right.

340
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,880
That's the, so you, what do you want to do
to learn programming?

341
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,720
The best way to learn programming is
having the code.

342
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,600
That is by somebody else.

343
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,520
Try to understand this.

344
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,580
But how do you understand this?

345
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,120
Just play around with it.

346
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,800
Try to modify and see what happens.

347
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,340
See if your understanding is what you
expected and what you see.

348
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,040
Okay.

349
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,160
That's the best way to learn.

350
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,720
By, by doing it.

351
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,980
And so that is the, the, the,
the, the, the, the, the, the,

352
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,700
the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

353
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,880
the, that is the no book for this.

354
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,480
And let me quickly go over this because we
will go some other notebook later on.

355
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,900
But for this notebook, if you want to
add a new cell.

356
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,280
So let's see.

357
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,020
Here.

358
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,100
I don't want to modify this code.

359
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:57,180
Because, once I modify, I forget what is
the original code if I mess up.

360
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,600
I'm not able to.

361
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,920
restore so what you can do is you just
copy the code so command a or control a

362
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,140
command a

363
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,710
and to copy the code and then you add a
new cell so you add a new cell so here

364
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,280
you add

365
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:20,900
see this plus code add a new cell now you
can you can paste here

366
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,850
copy and paste you can move it up upward
so let me move that upward all right so

367
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,520
now once you

368
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,170
do that and then you can modify here so
let's see I I'm not sure whether or not

369
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,820
this would

370
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,070
this work let's see greater equal right so
whether or not this will work

371
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:48,320
okay this will also work

372
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,660
right so that's the way you do it just

373
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,050
modify it and then so you you can see
result right away the nice thing about

374
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,200
the notebook

375
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,350
for this is it is very interactive
you you'll see the result immediately

376
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:05,500
okay that is one place to

377
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,700
learn which is Kaggle another place is
Google collab I'm going to give you a

378
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,900
notebook so

379
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,040
I'm going to give you a notebook and
you need to open this

380
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:06,290
and this notebook is what we are
going to do today and you should finish

381
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:12,440
the part I which I I deleted

382
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,160
some code I want you to fill it up so

383
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,900
let me share this overview

384
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,840
I'm going to put it on canvas now

385
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:46,440
so this will be class notebook

386
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,820
this is

387
00:30:50,900 --> 00:31:09,720
the first one all right you should see
this what do you do with this is a

388
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,040
little bit different but very similar
so click on this make sure you log in with

389
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,050
Google account click this and
you are going to see this you're going

390
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,060
to see

391
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:28,780
this and once you have this you also make
a copy so what do you do so I'll

392
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,770
wait everybody open this open
all right once you open go to file go here

393
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:38,760
go here

394
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,980
and save a copy in Drive

395
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:54,220
it will take a few second and open a new
copy and once you open that this

396
00:31:54,220 --> 00:32:02,740
notebook sit in your Google Drive where is
this this thing will be in your go to

397
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:08,220
your my drive and you are going to see
this yellow folder this yellow photo

398
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:14,500
called colab notebook it is inside there
you can move you should okay you

399
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:14,680
should

400
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,500
organize all your class notebook into
some specific folder so for this class

401
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,820
make a folder put everything
in there so it will be easy for you okay

402
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:26,140
everybody

403
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:37,420
made a copy all right so let's go over
this by object oriented programming it

404
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:44,280
means we are not doing the code line by
lines we are doing the code that

405
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:52,120
we created by writing words so we are not
doing the code diye so all these

406
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,020
calculations that you did are the code
that we figured out with Webplugs it's

407
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:59,660
going to help you on how to we should
refresh the browser when we have our

408
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,940
browser so I finished up the instruction
and let's go to so Goku's が

409
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:11,500
we should be able now to solve x 0.16
to solve x 0 .17 and obviously the

410
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,100
little round boast vídeo계

411
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,060
roof and then the doors and then you are
done.

412
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,840
The purpose for this is in when you do
the module,

413
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:28,920
it will be easy because say you are a
manager for the software development.

414
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,680
Now, if you have the break, break, break,

415
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:39,120
it will be hard to coordinate.
Now you have the modules.

416
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,280
So this group one, you do this module.
Group two, you do this module.

417
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:48,420
And after that, you assemble this.
Then for the manager,

418
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,340
what you want to pay attention to
is, let's say I have this wall and the

419
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,060
other wall over there,

420
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,940
but you need to have some kind of a
connection, right?

421
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,280
So you need to define what is
the connection between this module and

422
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,440
this module,

423
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,180
so they can perfectly align together.

424
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,380
So they need to talk to each other.

425
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,100
And what is it you need to do?

426
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,020
You have a similar idea for the
programming.

427
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,040
And in the old days, it is called
procedure programming.

428
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,020
So you just do it line by line or by some
functions.

429
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,380
And then this becomes when the software
becomes more complicated.

430
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:34,620
And the idea of the modularized
programming language came out.

431
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,760
So that is the object oriented one.

432
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,020
And in the,

433
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,020
in the case of the Python,

434
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,800
we call this thing as class.

435
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,460
Okay, what is class? Class is the module
itself.

436
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,140
Class is design of the module.

437
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,300
You want to design the wall.

438
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,980
So what is your blueprint for the wall?

439
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,740
I want to have three windows.

440
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,900
So you need to specify on your blueprint
three windows.

441
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,700
You also need to say,

442
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,920
what is the other side of the wall?

443
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,820
That is your design.

444
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,620
Once you have the design,

445
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,380
you can produce many,

446
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,580
many different walls.

447
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,540
That many different walls is a concrete.

448
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,880
It is a real wall.

449
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,100
Your definition,

450
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,600
which is the blueprint,

451
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,900
is not a real wall.

452
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,120
It is something,

453
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,080
it's your design.

454
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,460
So the idea for the class,

455
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,540
class is a design.

456
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,260
It's a blueprint.

457
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,220
It's not real.

458
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,740
From the class,

459
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,720
you can create the real stuff.

460
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,600
That is called object.

461
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,680
So that's the two key important concept.

462
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,720
Number one, class.

463
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,800
Class is the blueprint.

464
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,580
It's on the paper.

465
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,280
Okay, it is not a real thing.

466
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,680
On the paper.

467
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,800
And once you have the design,

468
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,300
you can create,

469
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,560
following the design,

470
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,180
create the real stuff.

471
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,320
That is called object.

472
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,780
Okay?

473
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,100
So in Python,

474
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,780
everything is object.

475
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,080
We will see that later on.

476
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,320
Everything is object.

477
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,120
If it is object,

478
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,160
in the object -oriented programming,

479
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,960
it means it has a class.

480
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,060
It is produced from some blueprint.

481
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,020
That blueprint is class.

482
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,840
So let's see this.

483
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,540
In Python,

484
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,440
you can have list.

485
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,660
You can have a string.

486
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,900
You can have a dictionary.

487
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,500
All this is,

488
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,320
should,

489
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,160
you should learn this from the

490
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,860
seven notebooks I just gave you.

491
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,100
So you have the list.

492
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,860
You have a string.

493
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,180
These are the different type of data.

494
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,180
And if you do have this,

495
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,020
let me,

496
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,820
instead of using this,

497
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,940
let me use

498
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,820
even more concrete.

499
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,040
So,

500
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,220
now,

501
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,400
that's your,

502
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,140
I want you to do.

503
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,660
Okay, now,

504
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,540
copy this.

505
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,300
Create a new cell.

506
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,480
Now,

507
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,180
you want to do something that is called a
list.

508
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:17,780
Now,

509
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,860
in Python,

510
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,480
list is this.

511
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,220
It's square bracket,

512
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,640
now followed by comma.

513
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,940
You can put things inside here.

514
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,380
It does not have to be numbers.

515
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,000
It can,

516
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,960
you can have some string.

517
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,440
String has to be quoted.

518
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,360
Okay, you can mix them together.

519
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,740
But it's a list.

520
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,840
It's just like a shopping list.

521
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,260
So list means object,

522
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:43,960
object,

523
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,520
object in ordered sequence.

524
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,540
It's a sequence,

525
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,120
right?

526
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
So that is this.

527
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,020
Once I have the list,

528
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,680
list has a property called class.

529
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:54,940
Okay,

530
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,620
that class has a name.

531
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,320
What I'm going to,

532
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,760
what I'm doing here is create a list.

533
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,880
Okay,

534
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,800
that's the first part.

535
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,720
Create a list.

536
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,680
And then,

537
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,340
from that list,

538
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,360
call its property.

539
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,940
Property is like your age,

540
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,580
your name,

541
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,900
your hair color,

542
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,780
your weight,

543
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,340
your height.

544
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,240
That's your attributes.

545
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,380
Now,

546
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:21,940
the class,

547
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,260
the object also has these attributes.

548
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,420
So one of the attributes is called

549
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,460
underscore,

550
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,700
underscore class.

551
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,360
One,

552
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,540
every time you see this underscore,

553
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:33,860
underscore,

554
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,200
it means it's built in stuff for Python.

555
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:37,940
Normally,

556
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,820
you do not need to worry about this

557
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,140
unless you have a special purpose.

558
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,020
It is something hiding from the user.

559
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,640
We are doing this to showcase

560
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,840
so you have a good understanding.

561
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,720
What is a class?

562
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,620
Why do I see everything is object?

563
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,860
So this is object.

564
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,180
And what is the blueprint for this?

565
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,420
That's class.

566
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,420
And this class has a name.

567
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,320
Dot name will show.

568
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,240
So if you run this,

569
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,100
the first line print out.

570
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,220
Okay,

571
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,300
the first time you start this,

572
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,260
see here,

573
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:15,560
connecting,

574
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,760
it will take some time.

575
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,780
It will allocate a computer for you

576
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,780
from Google.

577
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,840
So you have a unit of computing devices.

578
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,800
You treat this like a real computer.

579
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,240
And then,

580
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,960
one thing you can do is click here.

581
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,020
See,

582
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,780
it tells you,

583
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,600
click here.

584
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,960
It tells you what is the memory

585
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,980
and what is the disk you have.

586
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:44,780
So see,

587
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,980
I have a 12 gig memory.

588
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,660
I only use the one gig.

589
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,660
And my disk size is 10,

590
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,580
100.

591
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,460
I have used 32.

592
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,920
I didn't use that much

593
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,700
because the 32 is,

594
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,580
you need to have the system,

595
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,400
you have Python,

596
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,560
everything installed there.

597
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,600
So that's the pre-installed.

598
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,700
So here,

599
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,780
this is the class.

600
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,400
The class name is list.

601
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,880
Okay.

602
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,600
Now,

603
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,640
if you do this,

604
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,860
delete this name.

605
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,200
Let's do this.

606
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,680
Without this,

607
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,220
without this,

608
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,740
it will also print.

609
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,700
Now it print,

610
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,160
say,

611
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,880
like this.

612
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,560
What does that mean?

613
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,700
It means I'm printing an object.

614
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,300
This object is belong to a class of list.

615
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,800
All right.

616
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,580
So that means this thing,

617
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,360
it is object.

618
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,200
It is the blueprint for it.

619
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,120
It is class.

620
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,920
That class is this.

621
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,820
And similar for this,

622
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,260
string,

623
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,760
and similar for the dictionary.

624
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,280
So let me change this to the concrete
string.

625
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,240
So string is just,

626
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,200
just this.

627
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:08,800
Okay.

628
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:09,900
Quote,

629
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,080
single quote,

630
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:11,700
double quote,

631
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,340
doesn't matter.

632
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,520
Quote,

633
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,180
and then,

634
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,500
put in some string.

635
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,880
You can have anything.

636
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,640
You can have space.

637
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,080
You can have a single quote inside,

638
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,320
double quote.

639
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,580
And then,

640
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,060
that gave you this.

641
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,820
That gave you the string.

642
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,940
All right.

643
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,300
One nice feature for Python is

644
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,740
it allows you have the string

645
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,740
running multiple lines.

646
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,160
So what you do is

647
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,860
you have a triple quote

648
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,400
starting and ending with triple quote.

649
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,240
So everybody do this.

650
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:46,640
Now,

651
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,700
triple quote,

652
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,140
you can use single triple quote

653
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,100
or your double triple quote.

654
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,040
And once you do this,

655
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,700
you can have

656
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,300
all,

657
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,240
you can have multiple lines.

658
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,800
All right.

659
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,540
And then,

660
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,400
that will be the same.

661
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,260
That still give you the same.

662
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,880
So that is the string.

663
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,520
And for the dictionary,

664
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,500
let's also do something

665
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,160
for the dictionary.

666
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,580
Dictionary use the curly bracket.

667
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,680
Dictionary is like,

668
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,000
you look up at the dictionary,

669
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,620
right?

670
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,520
You have the,

671
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,160
let's say,

672
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,160
Vietnamese,

673
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:21,780
Chinese.

674
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,460
All right.

675
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,140
So you have the,

676
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,980
in Vietnamese,

677
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,880
you have the Vietnamese characters.

678
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,500
And for that character,

679
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,520
there's the entry.

680
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,340
Entry is Chinese.

681
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:30,820
All right.

682
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,620
So now,

683
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,320
you are going to have some,

684
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:33,860
let's see,

685
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,700
let's,

686
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,260
I'm not able to type Vietnamese,

687
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,500
let me type Chinese.

688
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,320
So,

689
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,200
I type Vietnam in Chinese.

690
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,420
And then,

691
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,700
I will say,

692
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,140
translate of this is,

693
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,700
let's use English.

694
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,200
Okay.

695
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:54,960
Then,

696
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,400
you are going to have

697
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,960
so that is the way you do for,

698
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,180
you have many,

699
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,400
many entries like this.

700
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,100
Each entry is separated by comma.

701
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,460
Okay.

702
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:04,700
Now,

703
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:04,920
not,

704
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,880
not the inside here.

705
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,180
Each entry is separated by,

706
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:08,760
by comma.

707
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,720
And now,

708
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,180
you can have,

709
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,640
say,

710
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,320
let's use Uno,

711
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,900
which is the Spanish.

712
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,240
And I'm going to use one

713
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,760
for English.

714
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,440
So that's my dictionary.

715
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,320
And that is also,

716
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,340
So when I do the class with the name, and
that's it, this.

717
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,230
One case thing for learning,
whether or not you have been doing well in

718
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,980
college or not,

719
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,760
it is very important to take notes.

720
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,880
Why it is important?

721
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,180
Taking notes as versus just the listening,
the difference is when you actively take

722
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,160
the

723
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,040
notes, instead of just taking the picture,
okay, that's different.

724
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,410
Instead of just taking the picture,
you not only record what has been

725
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,220
taught in the class,

726
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,700
you also process all the information in
your mind, and you make summarize.

727
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,500
Because you cannot write every word.

728
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,760
You have to get the key information
processed through your mind actively.

729
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:21,420
I'm not talking just in words.

730
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,380
I'm talking based on the data science
studies.

731
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,260
There are many research on this.

732
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,680
Students who actively taking notes
and students who do not, their outcome

733
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,860
is very different.

734
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:39,370
Also taking notes by typing on the
keyboard and taking notes by handwriting,

735
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:43,360
it is also

736
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:43,780
different.

737
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,720
Handwriting is more efficient in learning.

738
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,400
It activates your brain.

739
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,500
It activates your neurons in your mind.

740
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,060
So that is different.

741
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,320
Because when you write this, when you
write down a character, it doesn't matter

742
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,440
if it

743
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,120
is English or Chinese or Vietnamese.

744
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,720
You need to get a picture.

745
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:12,060
Your mind is, different part in your mind
has been activated, okay?

746
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,270
It is not just when you're typing, only
positional related neurons has

747
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:20,400
been activated because

748
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,600
there are only 26 keys I typed.

749
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,860
But when you write, it is the whole
picture.

750
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,540
That is different.

751
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:38,740
But for the code, you do not, you don't
have to use the pencil to write.

752
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,010
Typing the code is fine because here
we want to, we want everybody to run the

753
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,980
code.

754
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,000
You run, you put on the paper, it
doesn't run.

755
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:48,360
Okay.

756
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,140
So that is different.

757
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,440
However, for the key part, as I said,
when I say, what is class?

758
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,640
What is the object?

759
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,740
What is the relation between class
and object?

760
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,060
What is this?

761
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:00,480
Okay.

762
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,280
Let me do a quick check.

763
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,330
When you have the dot name and when you
do not have the dot name, what is the

764
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,680
difference?

765
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,480
See here.

766
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,810
When I have the, without the dot name,
and here I do have a dot name, what is the

767
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:17,040
difference?

768
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:33,580
Okay.

769
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,240
Let me see this again.

770
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,510
This is what I just said because if you
do not take the notes, you just forget it

771
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,660
right

772
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:42,900
away.

773
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,560
Remember, before I have this.

774
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,780
I have this.

775
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,160
I have a dot name.

776
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:56,220
So the printout, the printout is, is list.

777
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:56,760
Okay.

778
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,460
That's the list.

779
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:05,580
So what I have here is, first this thing,
this is class object.

780
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:06,900
Which one?

781
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,480
It is object.

782
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,280
Okay.

783
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,180
This is real stuff.

784
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,060
It is object.

785
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,300
But as I said, in Python, everything is
object.

786
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,040
If it is an object, it will have a
blueprint.

787
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,600
What is the blueprint called?

788
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,820
It's a class.

789
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,440
So what is the class for this?

790
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:37,660
So I have dot, underscore, underscore,
plus, no, this is the class of this.

791
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,140
However, this thing is another object.

792
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,040
It is not a string of a, called a class.

793
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,720
So now, this is another object.

794
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,220
Is this confusing?

795
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,500
This is object.

796
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,060
And the object has a attribute.

797
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,800
When we have a dot, something, it is an
attribute.

798
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,460
So your name is your attribute.

799
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:08,020
Your hair color, your height, that's your
attribute.

800
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,680
And this, this is attribute of this
object.

801
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:13,220
Okay.

802
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:17,860
And this attribute reference to something
else.

803
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,940
If this is something else, then it
is object.

804
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,760
Remember in Python, everything is
object, right?

805
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,140
So this is object.

806
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,720
We use another object to represent this
class.

807
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,760
Okay.

808
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,080
Everybody get the idea?

809
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,780
This is object.

810
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,640
Object has a class.

811
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,200
That class, how do you, how do you see
that class?

812
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,200
That class is also defined as a class.

813
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:43,360
Object.

814
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,540
All right.

815
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:48,480
So, if it is object, then it has
attribute.

816
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,700
One attribute is called an underscore,
underscore, name.

817
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,320
That is what you print out here.

818
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:02,070
If you do not have this, by default, if
you do not have this, by default,

819
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:06,400
Python will

820
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,000
try to find out what is the best way
to describe this object.

821
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,420
It has a built -in way to get the string
because once you print, everything has

822
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,840
to be converted

823
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,760
into string.

824
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,460
String is object, right?

825
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,520
So convert everything into string.

826
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,820
So now this class is object.

827
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:33,500
I need to convert this into some
string and then print out.

828
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,960
That is, that is what you have.

829
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,400
So this is a string.

830
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,320
However, once you have that, that means.

831
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,420
That special representation for that
class, okay?

832
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:52,860
And that is the, that is the dot and
the internal stuff.

833
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,360
This is internal, built-in stuff.

834
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:00,560
Another important stuff, another important
part, part is this.

835
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,280
So I have this list.

836
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,360
I did the same.

837
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,600
I add another class.

838
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,360
Remember, I, when I have this.

839
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,400
This is the attribute of the list, right?

840
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,700
Attribute of the list is another object.

841
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,760
So if it is object, it has a class.

842
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,700
Now, what is the class of this thing?

843
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,240
It also has a class.

844
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,520
And what is the class?

845
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,320
What is the name for this?

846
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,660
It is the type.

847
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,300
Okay.

848
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:39,540
When you have class as a list, class as
a string.

849
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,260
Class as a dictionary.

850
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,980
All these become one, there's a,
when you see the class, it is like a

851
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,260
parent.

852
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,600
Parent can have sons and daughters.

853
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,640
Because this is produced from the same
blueprint, right?

854
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,640
So now the parent is the class.

855
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,120
That parent is called a type.

856
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,640
That is data type.

857
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,780
In Python, there are many different data
types.

858
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,740
Each data type is a class.

859
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:13,440
But if you, if you call everything as
general, it is type.

860
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,600
It is data type.

861
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,440
So that's why you have this.

862
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,420
This is type.

863
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,560
Okay.

864
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:24,220
The key thing for this part is everything
is object.

865
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,400
Every object has attribute.

866
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:34,100
If you do dot something, that's access
to that object.

867
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,880
The attribute.

868
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:42,860
That attribute can be an object of
another class.

869
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,080
Okay?

870
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,920
So it is object of object.

871
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,560
All right?

872
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,480
And then, now let's see one example of the
class now.

873
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:56,540
Okay.

874
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,320
Let me pause a little bit here.

875
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:03,680
Make sure everybody okay with the idea
of object class attribute.

876
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,680
Three key things.

877
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:05,860
Okay.

878
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,360
One is object class attribute.

879
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,440
Make sure you do not mix, do not confuse.

880
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,100
Everybody okay?

881
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:15,760
Questions?

882
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,200
Yes?

883
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,260
Yeah.

884
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,340
That's, when I say parent, it
means, here it means class.

885
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,700
So when you have this, what is the
class of this?

886
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,460
This is the class of type.

887
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:34,880
Okay.

888
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,250
You can all, if you go everything for
the class and class on the very, very

889
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,620
top, there

890
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:45,080
is one single class that is called object.

891
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,620
It's just object.

892
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,960
In Python, this object means the parent, a
grandparent of everything, because

893
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,980
everything

894
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:55,720
is object.

895
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,160
Okay.

896
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,500
So you have the thing like, so now I
have this, this, and this, and this.

897
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,860
So the object for me is, is I object.

898
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:08,860
Right.

899
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:09,740
Yes.

900
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:10,400
Okay.

901
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:12,820
Yeah.

902
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,700
It's nested.

903
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,920
Every class can have object.

904
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,440
Every object must have a class.

905
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:21,960
Yes.

906
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,850
If you go for the class of class of class
of class, go to the top, it is one single

907
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:30,900
object.

908
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,820
That object is called, just called object.

909
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:34,760
That's it.

910
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,320
So it doesn't go any further.

911
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,920
That's built in.

912
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,060
That is built in for Python.

913
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,240
Okay.

914
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,090
In this case, we want to do a quick
demonstration for the object

915
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:49,520
and the class.

916
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,950
So what we want to do is if you open
the notebook, I think some of the, some

917
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:57,940
of the function

918
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,520
I have deleted the code.

919
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,680
So your notebook will be different
from mine.

920
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,900
Your job is after the class, you
fill up what has been missing.

921
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,500
It's your job.

922
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,800
So let's go over this.

923
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,900
When you define a class, you just use the
class.

924
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,100
See the blue one?

925
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,200
That means, this is called a keyword.

926
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,040
Keyword is reserved.

927
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,360
That means when you define some
function, you define your own variables,

928
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,960
do not use

929
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,500
the same, exactly the same thing.

930
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:29,680
Because you are messing up with, otherwise
you're messing up the built in stuff.

931
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,220
This is reserved for Python.

932
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:32,420
Okay.

933
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:40,940
Do not use exactly class as your
function name or your, your variable name.

934
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:41,740
Okay.

935
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:45,060
So now I have a definition for the class
and the name for that is called a

936
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,260
credit card.

937
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,560
Now I have a blueprint.

938
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:54,660
Let's say it's, this is the Bank of
America.

939
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:55,580
Okay.

940
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,640
I'm going to produce the credit card
from Bank of America.

941
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,220
And then this thing.

942
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,980
It always has a function.

943
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:10,400
This one, this is the definition of
function, DEF is definition of function.

944
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,460
And this is the function, function name.

945
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:16,520
Why do I have underscore, underscore in
it?

946
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,150
Every time when you have underscore,
underscore, it means you want to hide this

947
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,480
thing from

948
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:23,880
users.

949
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,200
Okay.

950
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,040
You want to hide this.

951
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:31,600
The advantage for hiding this is only,
let's say.

952
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,040
Only advanced users can mess up with this.

953
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,220
Do not do it if you do not understand it.

954
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,440
So that is the purpose.

955
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,280
So regular users do not see it.

956
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,560
They will not be able to mess up with
this.

957
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:51,680
And then why this, this is important for
this specific function.

958
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,790
This will be called, this function will
be called every time you create a new

959
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,840
object.

960
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,240
So we will see this later on.

961
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,720
And then it has a first parameter.

962
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:12,600
In function call, you always have
many different parameters.

963
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:18,040
But it is okay if you do not have any
parameter.

964
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:22,280
So you can have a function that
is empty like this.

965
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,580
That is fine.

966
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,540
In Python.

967
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,260
In Python.

968
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:28,820
In Python.

969
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,740
In Python syntax, it is okay.

970
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,280
It doesn't give you error.

971
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:37,940
However, for this specific function,
init, inside the class, it is required

972
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:42,220
you have

973
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:48,620
a first parameter reserved as a
reference to the object itself.

974
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,440
So you need to have, normally you call it,
call it itself.

975
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,500
Okay.

976
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:56,640
That means, because this is Blueprint.

977
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,080
Okay.

978
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:57,840
This is Blueprint.

979
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:04,400
Once you print, create a new credit
card, self means that concrete real

980
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:10,740
stuff is self.

981
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,000
Okay.

982
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,600
And because this Blueprint is not the
real stuff.

983
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:20,020
And then you can have some other stuff to
plug in your functions.

984
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,500
All right.

985
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,640
So for functions, anybody okay
with the idea of function?

986
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,060
The function is the same.

987
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,220
The function is the same as you have
learned in algebra.

988
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:30,880
Okay.

989
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,620
So you have a function.

990
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,180
You have some input.

991
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,060
Then you do some calculation.

992
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,420
You output something, right?

993
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:52,660
In the case of init, this is something
reserved.

994
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,200
You always have the first parameter as
self.

995
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,980
And then you have other stuff.

996
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,460
Here, I would say this will be the name,
which will be a string, name of the

997
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:06,640
customer.

998
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,020
And then I will say the bank.

999
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:09,620
Okay.

1000
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,080
In the case of Bank of America, it is
just the name Bank of America.

1001
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:18,320
Remember what is printed on your credit
card, your name, your bank, right?

1002
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:22,880
And then the account number, 16
digit account number.

1003
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,160
Okay.

1004
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,780
And there is other thing, that is the
every credit card has a limit, has a

1005
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:30,400
credit limit.

1006
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,400
You cannot charge over the limit.

1007
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,140
Let's say $2 ,000, okay?

1008
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,180
So that's the thing why you create the
credit card in the very beginning.

1009
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,460
You want to have.

1010
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,560
So that's the information here.

1011
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,620
And then let's forget about the expiration
and the pin number.

1012
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,000
Let's simplify this now.

1013
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:50,760
Questions?

1014
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,560
Yes.

1015
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,260
To identify the function, this is the
name of the function.

1016
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:03,680
Yeah.

1017
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:09,840
But when you call this function, you
do not call underscore, underscore, init.

1018
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,780
We will see how you call this function
later on.

1019
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,240
Okay.

1020
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,320
This is because this is a special
function.

1021
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:17,560
It is called automatically.

1022
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,360
You do not call it.

1023
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,480
Python will call it for you.

1024
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:22,860
Right.

1025
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,440
Automatically.

1026
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,240
Yeah.

1027
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,830
So, now, once you have this, what you do
is, because you are creating a new

1028
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:31,280
credit card,

1029
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,560
that credit card is the real thing.

1030
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,360
This is blueprint.

1031
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,340
That real thing is, has a reference
called self.

1032
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:46,500
Now, in this case, the name is the
attribute of the credit card.

1033
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:47,740
The.

1034
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:51,820
The bank is attribute of the credit card.

1035
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,260
The account number is attribute.

1036
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:58,240
So what you do is you define the customer
name, the bank, account, limit, and the

1037
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,860
balance,

1038
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,440
everything as attributes.

1039
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,200
Attached to self.

1040
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,580
Remember, self is the real credit card.

1041
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:15,560
Once you create the real credit card, it's
referenced as self.

1042
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,720
So, this is the real credit card.

1043
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,300
Again, when I use underscore, it
means this is internal thing.

1044
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,860
I do not want my customer to modify by
himself.

1045
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:30,350
See, if you really have a credit card,
you bank does not allow user to modify the

1046
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:33,240
name

1047
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,220
or the account number.

1048
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,540
You cannot do it.

1049
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,320
All right.

1050
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:41,640
So, we use underscore as a way to
represent this action.

1051
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,440
Okay.

1052
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,080
Yeah.

1053
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:44,760
You hide this.

1054
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,460
And then.

1055
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:49,680
But in the beginning, you have zero
balance.

1056
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,960
So that is this.

1057
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:58,360
And then, what you do is let
me let's first ignore the remaining part.

1058
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,360
Run this.

1059
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:03,220
Now, everybody, if you have the
notebook open, run this cell.

1060
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,700
Run this cell.

1061
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,420
And then, once you have this, and what you
do is you can do this.

1062
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,580
You create a new object.

1063
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,500
This new object is.

1064
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:16,700
Okay.

1065
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,280
This is the name.

1066
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:17,600
Okay.

1067
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,300
Class name is credit card.

1068
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:19,520
Right?

1069
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:25,100
Put the name of the class and like
calling a function for this.

1070
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:30,920
Put this as the parameter, which is the
name bank.

1071
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:31,660
Let's see.

1072
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,400
Bank of America.

1073
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,760
And then, let's see.

1074
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:41,420
You should have 16 numbers.

1075
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,600
And then, you put the limit.

1076
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:44,280
So.

1077
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:49,020
Once you do that, and you can print out
what is CC.

1078
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,120
So, this is called assign.

1079
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,480
We do not say equal.

1080
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:00,280
If you say equal, it is prone to get
errors for your understanding.

1081
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:08,200
Some students are confused by assigning
to the right -hand side.

1082
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:13,980
When you say assign, it means I have
something on the left-hand side.

1083
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:19,060
I want to put what I have on
the right-hand side to my left-hand side.

1084
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:19,720
Okay.

1085
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:23,260
Always read this from right to left.

1086
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,900
So, it means call this function.

1087
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,160
In this case, it is class.

1088
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:31,180
It is not a function.

1089
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,020
Call this class create object.

1090
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:36,720
Now you have object.

1091
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,280
This is real.

1092
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,300
It is a real credit card.

1093
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:42,620
It has name.

1094
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:43,860
It has limit.

1095
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,960
It has account number.

1096
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,840
And then, assign it to CC.

1097
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,060
So, this CC, when you print out, it is
this.

1098
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,920
It is in the main, which is your program.

1099
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,480
The object of the whole program called
main.

1100
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:05,500
And inside main, there is a credit card
at this memory position.

1101
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,900
In some memory position.

1102
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,680
Python knows how to get there.

1103
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,480
You don't need to know that.

1104
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,160
Okay.

1105
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,840
It is just something set in your memory.

1106
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:19,940
So, when I shut down my computer,
let's see this.

1107
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:24,300
If you go over here, close this, then
it's gone.

1108
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,580
Everything is gone.

1109
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,920
And because this is in the memory, and
it's gone.

1110
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,440
You do not have access to it.

1111
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:32,340
Unless you save this in disk.

1112
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,580
And by the way, one thing.

1113
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,300
So, go here.

1114
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:37,980
Runtime.

1115
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,380
Runtime allows you to interrupt.

1116
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:45,040
And allows you to disconnect.

1117
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,900
So, why do you do the disconnect?

1118
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:53,700
When you finish using this notebook, just
disconnect this.

1119
01:03:53,940 --> 01:04:02,600
The reason is everybody has limited hours
to use the free notebook from Google.

1120
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,940
If you use up for today, then you
cannot use anymore.

1121
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,460
Tomorrow, you will have another.

1122
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,000
Let's see.

1123
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:11,860
Three hours.

1124
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,420
Everybody has three hours every day.

1125
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,840
So, if you finish, just close it.

1126
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:17,720
Do not use.

1127
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,400
Let it running.

1128
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,780
Use up your quota.

1129
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,540
Do not let it running.

1130
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:30,100
And if you close this tab, it also closes.

1131
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,300
Okay.

1132
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,220
But that will take some time.

1133
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,140
Not immediately.

1134
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,020
And that is the way you create object.

1135
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,440
And as I said.

1136
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,820
Everything is object.

1137
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:47,160
If you type object, that's the top object
for everything.

1138
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,560
It is internal object.

1139
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:51,580
Okay.

1140
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,120
And then we define something as a
function.

1141
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,400
Now, I define a function.

1142
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:59,380
This function in the class is called
method.

1143
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,640
Because why it is called method?

1144
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:03,400
It is like this.

1145
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,720
You have object.

1146
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,020
Now, these are the method.

1147
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,700
Because once you push.

1148
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,180
Some action happens.

1149
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:12,340
All right.

1150
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,280
So, that's the same.

1151
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,580
When I push this button.

1152
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,700
It is going to have something is going to
happen.

1153
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:23,100
So, in this case, what I want to do is
when I push this button.

1154
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,020
What I want is give me the name of the
customer.

1155
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,100
So, dot underscore customer gave
me the name of the customer.

1156
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,840
So, that what you return.

1157
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,380
That is why you call the function.

1158
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,000
It will return.

1159
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,400
One thing I didn't mention before.

1160
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,560
In the example is this.

1161
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,840
This is internally called as I said.

1162
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,100
When does this call?

1163
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:51,240
See, if you have this line.

1164
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,720
Class name followed by the parentheses.

1165
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:01,140
It will call the underscore, underscore
init function.

1166
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:03,400
It will call this function.

1167
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,300
When this function has been called.

1168
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,180
First thing is create.

1169
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,520
It an object.

1170
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,280
And assign it as self.

1171
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,420
And then.

1172
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:20,400
This is the first parameter when
you create this.

1173
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,900
See, the first parameter.

1174
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,320
John Doe.

1175
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,180
It's not self.

1176
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:30,000
This thing is defined as the second.

1177
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,380
Okay.

1178
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,860
Let me stress this again.

1179
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,020
When you call a function.

1180
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,620
What happens?

1181
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,500
So, when you call a function.

1182
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,960
You have a class.

1183
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:52,620
Okay.

1184
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:53,340
You have a class.

1185
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,220
Which is Blueprint.

1186
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,400
Inside the class.

1187
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:59,220
You have this function.

1188
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,900
That's a special function.

1189
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,480
And now.

1190
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:07,600
This is a credit card.

1191
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,740
Credit card.

1192
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,380
Plus.

1193
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,580
Now I call this.

1194
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,260
Credit card.

1195
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,100
I call this function.

1196
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:30,540
By.

1197
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,460
Let's see the customer name.

1198
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,420
And the bank account limit.

1199
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,580
Okay.

1200
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,100
When I call this.

1201
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:42,140
When I create new credit card.

1202
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:42,760
From this.

1203
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:43,640
Okay.

1204
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:45,500
What happens is.

1205
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,820
After Python see this.

1206
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,200
See this line.

1207
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:54,840
It will first go over the reference of
this.

1208
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,560
Class.

1209
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,240
And find out what is this.

1210
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,700
And then.

1211
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,380
Create a real object.

1212
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,560
Let's see the real object.

1213
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,520
Is this.

1214
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,220
Credit card.

1215
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:11,500
Okay.

1216
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,180
Create a credit card.

1217
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,500
That's a real credit card.

1218
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:15,760
But for now.

1219
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:16,820
It doesn't have a name.

1220
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,480
Doesn't have an account number yet.

1221
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:20,020
It's the plastic.

1222
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:21,660
Now.

1223
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,440
Go over here.

1224
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,960
Put this thing.

1225
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,200
As self.

1226
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,980
That's the first step.

1227
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:32,900
Create it.

1228
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,120
And.

1229
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,720
Reference this as self.

1230
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,320
And then.

1231
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,460
Now you call this function.

1232
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,280
Next step is call this function.

1233
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,920
Because this function says.

1234
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,280
First parameter is self.

1235
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,740
So you have to have.

1236
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:53,460
Something called self.

1237
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:54,660
First.

1238
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,340
Then you call this function.

1239
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,000
So.

1240
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,700
That self for now is the blank plastic
stuff.

1241
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:04,380
And you put this.

1242
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,880
Put it here as self.

1243
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,040
And then you put other things.

1244
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,160
Other than name.

1245
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,040
Account number.

1246
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:10,360
Bank.

1247
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:11,340
Account number.

1248
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:11,700
Limit.

1249
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,500
And once you have that.

1250
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,100
It will use the dot.

1251
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:15,880
Something dot.

1252
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:16,480
Something dot.

1253
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:16,800
Something.

1254
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:19,020
To attach to that.

1255
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:19,300
That.

1256
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,220
That means this.

1257
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,080
Create.

1258
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:21,980
Create.

1259
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:22,900
Something.

1260
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,940
On your credit card.

1261
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,700
So that's the whole idea of the.

1262
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,020
Class and object.

1263
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,040
Just remember now.

1264
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:30,880
Okay.

1265
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:32,700
This thing.

1266
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,460
That's the blueprint.

1267
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,280
This thing.

1268
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:39,240
After you call the init function.

1269
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,620
It gave you a real credit card.

1270
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,820
It is real stuff.

1271
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,540
It has the name and everything else.

1272
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,400
Okay.

1273
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,860
So that is the way.

1274
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:48,760
This.

1275
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,120
Work.

1276
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:50,920
And then.

1277
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:53,520
We are going to have some other things.

1278
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,880
We have.

1279
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,020
Function called.

1280
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:58,640
Get.

1281
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:00,500
Get.

1282
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:02,060
Customer.

1283
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,740
And this function.

1284
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,440
See here.

1285
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:04,740
Now.

1286
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,020
It has only self.

1287
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:09,720
It doesn't have anything else.

1288
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:11,980
So how do you call this function.

1289
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:13,640
When you call this function now.

1290
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,040
Everybody follow me.

1291
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,340
CC dot.

1292
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,000
Then you get.

1293
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:24,460
Customer.

1294
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:26,060
All right.

1295
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,160
That's the way you call it.

1296
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,000
You do not need to put self.

1297
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,720
Where is self now.

1298
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,840
Self is here.

1299
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,100
See.

1300
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:35,480
CC is self.

1301
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:39,400
So everybody understand the logic.

1302
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,320
When you call this function.

1303
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:42,700
Get.

1304
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,220
Customer.

1305
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,500
It is actually calling this function.

1306
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:47,160
However.

1307
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,700
The self is now attached to CC.

1308
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,560
You do not need to put anything here.

1309
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:55,500
Just put empty.

1310
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,500
And then.

1311
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,240
It will give you.

1312
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,220
John Doe.

1313
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:03,420
Okay.

1314
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,140
That is what we have here.

1315
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:05,920
See here.

1316
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:07,920
Everybody.

1317
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:08,800
Get this.

1318
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:10,920
Okay.

1319
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:11,560
That's the way.

1320
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:12,840
It works.

1321
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:13,260
And.

1322
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:13,880
Now.

1323
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:14,800
This.

1324
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,540
This is.

1325
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,940
This is a.

1326
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:17,920
Object.

1327
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:19,460
CC is object.

1328
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:21,800
Yes.

1329
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:26,580
Right.

1330
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:30,900
Yes.

1331
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:31,020
Yes.

1332
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:32,540
Okay.

1333
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,700
Let me repeat this again.

1334
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,620
This is Blueprint.

1335
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:39,260
This is Blueprint.

1336
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,700
From the Blueprint.

1337
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,840
You want to create a real credit card.

1338
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,040
How do you do it?

1339
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,460
Just write down the same class name.

1340
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,900
Followed by the parentheses.

1341
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:50,540
Then.

1342
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:54,240
You put in all the required parameters for
this class.

1343
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,480
In this case.

1344
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,520
Is everything except of self.

1345
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:58,720
So.

1346
01:11:58,760 --> 01:11:59,120
Now.

1347
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,860
First thing is.

1348
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:01,800
Custom name.

1349
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,480
That's John Doe.

1350
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,080
Bank of America.

1351
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,740
And account number.

1352
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:08,340
And 1000 limit.

1353
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:09,460
And then.

1354
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:10,820
After that.

1355
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,160
A new credit card has been produced.

1356
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:14,400
So.

1357
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:15,720
Let's call it CC.

1358
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,380
Once you have that.

1359
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:19,100
CC.

1360
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,300
Then.

1361
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,060
Now.

1362
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:23,680
Everything defined as the.

1363
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:24,960
See.

1364
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,700
I have indentation here.

1365
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:28,060
Class indent.

1366
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:31,900
Everything defined inside the class.

1367
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,940
Now is attribute.

1368
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,280
It's like attribute.

1369
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:35,760
But.

1370
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,980
Actually this attribute is a function.

1371
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,840
We call this method.

1372
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,720
And the way to call that is.

1373
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:43,780
Use.

1374
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:44,900
CC.

1375
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,340
CC.

1376
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,440
And once you call this.

1377
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:51,460
This CC will plug into self.

1378
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:52,140
So.

1379
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:52,780
When you call this.

1380
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:53,720
Get customer.

1381
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,480
This CC.

1382
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:56,880
Will jump.

1383
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:57,880
Here.

1384
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:01,740
Once you have CC jumped here.

1385
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:02,680
Then.

1386
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:03,420
Because.

1387
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,280
Previously.

1388
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,500
You attached John Doe to CC.

1389
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:07,940
Now.

1390
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:08,820
You can get it.

1391
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,620
John Doe out.

1392
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:11,660
Everybody.

1393
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:12,680
Get the idea.

1394
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:14,460
So.

1395
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,320
That's the way it works.

1396
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,300
Now.

1397
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,100
And then.

1398
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,260
You can get the other thing.

1399
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:18,800
Get bank.

1400
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:19,440
Get account.

1401
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:20,820
And.

1402
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:21,900
Now.

1403
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,760
A little bit more.

1404
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,280
Complicated is charge.

1405
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:25,300
So.

1406
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:25,380
Now.

1407
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:26,280
You have a credit card.

1408
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,200
You swipe.

1409
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,160
Now.

1410
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:29,000
You charge this.

1411
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:29,400
But.

1412
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,740
You do not want to just charge.

1413
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:32,220
Arbitrarily.

1414
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:32,700
First.

1415
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,560
You want to make sure.

1416
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:34,400
You do not over.

1417
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:35,760
Your limit.

1418
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:36,880
So.

1419
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:37,680
If you want to.

1420
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:39,820
If you want to buy a laptop.

1421
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,080
With 1000 limit.

1422
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:41,660
Probably.

1423
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:42,820
You will not be able to do it.

1424
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:43,940
And then.

1425
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:44,560
So.

1426
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:45,860
The first.

1427
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,100
Thing.

1428
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,580
The first thing.

1429
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:48,680
You want to do is.

1430
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,700
You want to compare.

1431
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:52,360
That.

1432
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,240
When you charge.

1433
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:53,920
With the price.

1434
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:55,980
You already have.

1435
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:56,520
Some balance.

1436
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,080
In the very beginning.

1437
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:58,500
It is zero.

1438
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,600
And then.

1439
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,180
After you.

1440
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:00,660
You.

1441
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:01,520
You.

1442
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:02,060
Charge.

1443
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,240
Many times.

1444
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:03,560
It.

1445
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,240
Accrued.

1446
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:05,740
The balance.

1447
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:06,720
And then.

1448
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:07,220
The total.

1449
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,160
Total.

1450
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:08,880
New balance.

1451
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:09,540
Will be.

1452
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:10,060
The price.

1453
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:10,460
Plus.

1454
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,560
The existing balance.

1455
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:12,820
You make sure.

1456
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:13,700
If.

1457
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,520
This is.

1458
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,640
Over the limit.

1459
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:16,720
You.

01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,840
Are not going to.

1461
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:18,540
Succeed.

1462
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,340
In charging.

1463
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:19,700
This.

1464
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:21,240
Otherwise.

1465
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:22,000
It is.

1466
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:22,500
Succeed.

1467
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:23,800
You are going to.

1468
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:25,080
Add the price.

1469
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:25,920
To your balance.

1470
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:26,740
And.

1471
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,380
You return.

1472
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:28,440
The Boolean.

1473
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,420
In this case.

1474
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:29,800
Is true.

1475
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,420
Okay.

1476
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:31,360
Success.

1477
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:32,740
And.

1478
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,160
Then.

1479
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:33,880
See.

1480
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,740
If you want to make.

1481
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,220
A payment.

1482
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:36,580
This.

1483
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,400
You use.

1484
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:37,900
The plus.

1485
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:38,720
Because.

1486
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:39,440
Every time.

1487
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,040
You add.

1488
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,120
The balance.

1489
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:41,740
You charge.

1490
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,000
It.

1491
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:42,720
But.

1492
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,360
If you want.

1493
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:43,980
To pay out.

1494
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,240
Your.

1495
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,440
Credit card.

1496
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,620
You subtract.

1497
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:47,520
The balance.

1498
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:47,900
Right.

1499
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:48,600
So.

1500
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:49,240
If you pay.

1501
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:50,320
If you pay.

1502
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:50,940
Some amount.

1503
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:51,940
You subtract.

1504
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:52,740
The amount.

1505
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:53,100
So.

1506
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:53,460
When you.

1507
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,120
Have this.

1508
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:54,860
That means.

1509
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:55,860
That means.

1510
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:56,520

Let me.

1513

Write down.

1514
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:01,960
Something.

1515
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:04,880
It will be.

1516
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,320
This.

1517
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:07,200
Amount.

1518
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:07,980
Okay.

1519
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:08,340
That's.

1520
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:08,860
Exactly.

1521
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,240
The same.

1522
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:09,680
As this.

1523
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:10,780
You have.

1524
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,200
Minus.

1525
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:12,900
Equal.

1526
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:13,460
That is.

1527
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:13,820
This.

1528
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,160
It is doing.

1529
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:16,300
Subtracting.

1530
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:16,720
On itself.

1531
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:17,500
Okay.

1532
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,260
That is.
